# DotsAndBoxes
Dots and Boxes is a game for two players (or more). It was first published in the 19th century by Edouard Lucas, who called it originally la pipopipette. Starting with an empty grid of dots, two players take turns adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent dots. The player who completes the fourth side of a 1x1 box (or groups of one or more adjacent boxes) earns one point (s) and takes another turn.
